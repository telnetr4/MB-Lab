            <h3><a name="faq0-1">0.1</a> Can I use 2D renderings of the models created with ManuelbastioniLAB for commercial 2D comics, 2D videos, 2D illustrations?</h3>

            <p>See the answer to <a href="faq.html#faq1-13">FAQ 1.13</a></p>

            <h3><a name="faq0-2">0.2</a> When downloading it I did not get a zip file but a folder with a lot of files and trying to install it in Blender does nothing.  Can you help me?</h3>


            <p>Some browsers, for example Safari, have an option to decompress zip files automatically on download. You should change this in your preferences.</p>

            <h3><a name="faq0-3">0.3</a> How can I help you in the development of the lab?</h3>


            <p>The best way to help the lab project is to increase its popularity. A project with a big community grows better and faster.</p>
            <p>If you have a video channel (for example on Youtube), you can create your videos to review the lab or to explain how to use it,
            you can spread the word about new releases or new features,
            using your social pages or your preferred online places,
            you can also help newbie users replying to their questions.
            If you are a reporter you can also write articles about the lab and <a href="contacts.html">contact</a> Manuel Bastioni to receive more info and news.</p>
            <p>When you create your animations, graphic novels, comics, it would be nice to mention the use of the lab and <a href="contacts.html">contact</a> the lab developer,
            so your work will be eligible to appear on the official social pages of the lab.</p>
            <p>If you are a researcher and you have used the lab for academic publications or thesis, please contact the lab author:
            he likes to know the cool things done with the lab and show them to the other users.</p>
            <p>Another way to help the project is providing high quality feedbacks and <a href="guide_bugs_report.html">bugs report</a>.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, 3d assets (models, texture, animations, ecc.) and code created by external contributors are not used in the lab,
            because they involve bureaucracy and legal issues: identity of contributor, proof of authorship, transfer of copyrights, license agreement, etc.
            All 3d assets and all code included in the lab are created from scratch by Manuel Bastioni.</p>

            <h3><a name="faq0-4">0.4</a> Why the lab is not included directly in Blender official release?</h3>


            <p>There are three problems in inclusion of the lab in Blender:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Characters matter requires a more complex license than the standard Blender output.
            The current lab license take account of a lot of things, for example, please
            take a look to the FAQ 1.8 here, that explains the importance of the
            <a href="faq.html#faq1-8">"no-restriction" clause</a> </li>

            <li>The lab is expensive in terms of package size. With the completion of texture editor,
            it will require more textures and perhaps it will gradually reach 100 MB</li>

            <li>The lab is released more frequently than Blender, and an integrated version
            can be quickly obsolete, creating confusion.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Example of scenario: John creates three characters using ManuelbastioniLAB then
            John adds some alien clothes, hair and morphings modelled by him and puts them in his
            own closed source game, released with his "John's license"<a href="faq.html#note-1">[*]</a>
            </p>

            <p>John must put in a visible place, for example in game credits or in game license a statement like this one:</p>

            <div class="separator">&nbsp;</div>

            <p><em>"The 3d models A, B and C are generated using the open source tool “ManuelbastioniLAB” so A, B and C are derivative of the characters

            <h3><a name="faq1-8">1.8</a> Why have you used the CC-BY? It has the "No additional restrictions" that limits my freedom. Why not the CC0?</h3>


            <p>
            This clause is required in any serious license to preserve the freedom of the users.
            What will happen without it, for example, if 10 users generate the same character (using the same preset for the characters library, for example)
            and one of them puts the effective technological measures on it? Should the other 9 ask his permission to use their character?
            No, because the CC-BY fixes this problem with its "No additional restrictions" clause: nobody can add additional restrictions to the models generated with the lab.<br />
            Any user can include a CC-BYed character in his commercial or non commercial product (respecting the attribution, of course), protect his product with his license,
            but his license can't restrict the freedom of other users that want to use the same model.

            </p>

            <p>
            A clause similar to this one is present practically in any commercial license, because, for example, if someone buys a model from a 3D store,
            he can't prevent others from buy the same model and use it for their purpose, and of course he can't complain that now the 3D store is selling his model!
            </p>

            <p>
            Note that a similar restriction is implicitly applied to things released in Public Domain.
            </p>

            <p>
            You can't get something released under Public Domain (for example with CC0) and put your copyright directly on it, because this will prevent others from using it.<br />
            Basically you can't say "this CC0 model now is mine and from now on nobody else can use it", because you are using a model that is... under Public Domain!
            </p>

            <p>
            In other words, you can use a CC0ed model in your commercial package but you can't limit the freedom of others that want to use the same CC0ed model: anyone has the right to use
            something released under Public Domain.
            </p>


            <p>
            So, under this point of view, the principal difference between a CC0ed model and a CC-BYed model is only that the latter requires the attribution.
            You can use a CC-BYed model in your commercial package that use your own commercial license, but your license can't prevent others from being free to create a similar model using directly the lab.
            For these reasons I choosed the CC-BY license.
            </p>

            <div class="separator">&nbsp;</div>

            <h3><a name="faq1-9">1.9</a> Can I create a closed source character editor using lab characters?</h3>

            <p>The morphing database is released under the Open Source license AGPL (See the <a href="guide_license.html">license page</a>)
            in order to avoid that someone creates a closed source clone of the lab. Any attempt of reverse engineering to extract the morph library with the intention to release it with a different license is an AGPL infringement.
            </p>

            <p>Anyway it was decided to consent a double license for the models generated by the official ManuelbastioniLAB software, so you can generate a character (that includes expressions
            shapekeys) and use it in your closed source game under the terms of CC-BY 4.0 (See <a href="faq.html#faq1-3">FAQ 1.3</a> above.)
            </p>

            <p>Thanks to the CC-BY option, you can also generate multiple CC-BYed characters and mix them in your closed character editor, but clearly you cannot use this as trick to
            extract a large portion of the morphing library, since it would be considered as reverse engineering.
            </p>

            <p>Concerning the meaning of "large portion of the morphing library" see the  <a href="faq.html#faq1-11">FAQ 1.11</a>
            </p>


            <div class="separator">&nbsp;</div>

            <h3><a name="faq1-10">1.10</a> What happens if I modify the script to generate characters that include the lab morphs as shapekeys? Will I obtain a CC-BY morph library?</h3>

            <p>No. According to the legal terms, the double license can be applied only to the output of unmodified script. Any ouput from unofficial versions is AGPL only.
            In other words, your modified script is a bit reverse-engineeringish and will break the double license option: all the generated characters will be not CC-BY, but AGPL. For details please read the section "LICENSE OF MODELS GENERATED BY THE SOFTWARE" in the <a href="guide_license.html">license page</a>.

            <h3><a name="faq1-11">1.11</a> How many lab characters can I mix in a closed source character editor?</h3>

            <p>

                The <a href="faq.html#faq1-9">FAQ 1.9</a> says: <em>"Thanks to the CC-BY option, you can
                also generate multiple CC-BYed characters and mix them in your closed character editor,
                but clearly you cannot use this as trick to extract a large portion of the morphing library,
                since it would be considered as reverse engineering."</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                Many artists asked for a better definition of "large portion" of database,
                since they want to include a CLOSED SOURCE character editor in their game using models generated with the lab with the CC-BY license option, but they
                have some doubts about the AGPL restrictions. Here are some guidelines to help them.
            </p>
            <p>
                These notes are just a clarification: they ARE NOT PART OF THE <a href="guide_license.html">LICENSE</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                First of all, it's needed to quickly define some terms:
            </p>

            <p>
                <ul>
                <li>"Character creator": The external software, part of a game, that works mixing a set of characters created with ManuelbastioniLAB.</li>
                <li>"Character class": one of the base categories available in ManuelbastioniLAB. To clarify with an example, in version 1.5 there are 15 available classes:
                Caucasian female, Asian female, Afro female, Caucasian male, Asian male, Afro male, Anime female style shojo01, Anime female style shojo02,
                Anime female style realistic, Anime man style shojo01,  Anime man style shojo02,  Anime man style realistic, Elf female,
                Elf male, Dwarf male.</li>
                <li>"User": The one who is using the lab to generate the characters and/or wants to create the character creator.</li>
                <li>"Morphs": Modelling morphs (also called "shapekeys") derived from the ManuelbastioniLAB database.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                It's not easy to define a precise  numeric threshold for extracted data, since it depends not only
            by the amount of morphs extracted, but also by their complexity and by their usage in the character creator.
            So the best way to help you is to give a practical example of a right usage that is NOT considered reverse engineering:
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>
                With the lab, for each character class, the user creates five types of bodies and five types of faces,
                then mixes them in its character creator. The character creator doesn't extract sub-features, like types of noses or types of eyes,
                but only interpolates  whole faces and whole bodies. For example the character creator can create a new face with a
                linear interpolation like 0.3*face1 + 0.3*face2 + 0.4*face3.
                </em>
            </p>

            <p>
                The usage described in this example is OK: it permits to have a flexible character editor with hundreds of combinations, but in the same time
                it uses only a small amount of morph database and it's not a competitor of the lab, because it's not comparable with the millions of combinations available in ManuelbastioniLAB.
                Also it would be nice if the user shows his clearness and good faith promoting the lab and the Open Source phylosophy in his game.
            </p>

            <div class="separator">&nbsp;</div>

            <h3><a name="faq1-12">1.12</a> According to ManuelbastioniLAB license, if I modify the lab then the characters generated with my version
            cannot be used under the CC-BY license, but only under AGPL3.
            Considering this, what's the best approach to add new features?</h3>

            <p>
                The best way to proceed is to create an addon completely separated and independent from the lab,
                that works on finalized lab characters, after the lab session is ended.
            </p>
            <p>
                The resulting pipeline will be straight and clear, without legal issues and other problems
                (as example of issues, see the last part of <a href="faq.html#faq0-3">FAQ 0.3</a>):<br />
                <em>ManuelbastioniLAB -> lab character (CC-BY) -> YourAddon -> Modified character (unaltered lab elements still
                under CC-BY + new features under your license).</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the two addons will operate in two well separated and independent steps,
                the license of the resulting character will be the same examinated in <a href="faq.html#faq1-5">FAQ 1.5</a>.
            </p>

            <h3><a name="faq1-13">1.13</a> I created a 2D image rendering that depicts some lab characters. What license I have to use for this 2D image?</h3>

            <p>Rendered two-dimensional images or two-dimensional videos of a scene that includes 3D models generated with
            ManuelbastioniLAB are not considered a derived product of the licensed 3D database and 3D base models.</p>

            <p>Assuming that the rendering depicts a non-reverse-engineering scene[*], due to many factors (i.e. the transformation from 3D space to 2D space,
            the position and the type of camera used, the other 3D elements included in the scene,
            the position and type of lights, the post production, the composition of multiple characters,
            the path of the camera, ecc.) the original 3D data is fundamentally modified and transformed
            sufficiently that it constitutes an original work.</p>

            <p>For this reason, the author of the 2D rendering is <em>the sole copyright owner</em> of 2D image/video created
            by him and the sole responsible for the use of his 2D image/video.</p>

            <p>Also the author of the 2D rendering can use <em>any license</em> for the two-dimensional image/video created
            by him and of course he can use his two-dimensional image/video for commercial projects.</p>

            <p>[*] For example, an orthographic rendering of a 
            shadeless plane with lab textures on it, will be considered as reverse engineering scene for textures extraction.</p>

            <div class="separator">&nbsp;</div>


            <h3><a name="faq2-1">2.1</a> Is there a way to have two characters in the same scene?</h3>

            <p>ManuelBastioniLAB is not designed to work on multiple characters in the same scene.</p>

            <p>The software is focused on a professional pipeline, where the design
            of the character occurs in a step completely separated from the animation phase.</p>

            <p>Basically you have to think to ManuelBastioniLAB as a separate software, designed to work on
            one character at time, in order to create the geometry, the rigging, the texture, the clothes
            and then export it in your folder of characters, ready to be appended in your future final 3d scenes.</p>

            <p>There are also many technical reasons for this decision, too long to describe here.
            To resume in few words: the features are very complex and handle them for multiple characters
            can potentially create problems, for example the ManuelBastioniLAB morphing system can't be
            used simultaneously with animated shapekeys and Blender undo system doesn't handle all the lab steps. </p>


            <div class="separator">&nbsp;</div>

            <h3><a name="faq2-2">2.2</a> What is the best pipeline to use for create and use characters with ManuelBastioniLAB?</h3>

            <p>The software is optimised for the pipeline described in the chapter <a href="guide_finalize_the_character.html">Finalize the character for production scene</a>.</p>

            <div class="separator">&nbsp;</div>

            <h3><a name="faq2-3">2.3</a> Why I can't add or delete vertices of characters?</h3>

            <p>Due to the linear morphing algorithm used to morph the base mesh, the order and the number of vertices can't be altered.</p>

            <h3><a name="faq2-4">2.4</a> Can I remove the censor?</h3>

            <p>In order to be worldwide 100% "safe for work" all lab characters do not include genitalia. Also the pelvis area
            and the female breast are covered with a black censor material. </p>
            <p>If it's required to remove the censor, it can be done simply replacing the black material with the skin material in Blender panel,
            as shown in the <a href="guide_tips.html#remove_censor">tips page</a>.</p>

            <h3><a name="faq3-1">3.1</a> I'm trying to create my own rigging, but when I use Blender auto weighting function, it returns an error. Can you help me?</h3>

            <p>The auto weighting function in Blender works only on connected geometries.
            So You have to <a href="guide_finalize_the_character.html">finalize</a> the character,
            split it in pieces with connected topology (body, eyes, teeth, etc..) and then rig each piece separately.</p>

            <h3><a name="faq4-1">4.1</a> What should I do to respect the AGPL license for models generated with ManuelbastioniLAB?</h3>

            <p>If you prefer to use the AGPL license for character generated with ManuelbastioniLAB
            (so it will be usable only in opensource and AGPL compatible software),
            you have to include in your package a copy of AGPL license and a copy of this legal notice:
