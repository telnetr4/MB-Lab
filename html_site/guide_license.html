            <h1>LICENSE OF MODELS GENERATED BY THE SOFTWARE.</h1>

            <p>The AGPL can be an obstacle in case 
            someone wants to create a closed source game or closed source 3D models using
            3D characters made with the lab because the AGPL will propagate 
            from the base models and from the database to the output models.</p>

            <p>For this reason it was decided to consent a double license ONLY for the models generated 
            by the official software<a href="guide_license.html#official_software">*</a>, NOT for the source code, NOT for the 
            json database and NOT for blend files included in the distribution:</p>

            <img src="images/agpl_logo.png" width="155" height="51" alt="" class="left"/>
                <p>The default license for models generated by the software 
              is AGPL 3: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html</a>. As derived product of the
              AGPL'd database, the models must be distribuited under AGPL 3, with the same copyright of the database.</p>

                <p>Alternatively, for closed source games or closed source 3D models, it's possible to choose, 
              for characters generated by the official[<a href="guide_license.html#official_software">*</a>] software, the Attribution 4.0 International,

            <h1>NOTE ABOUT 2D RENDERING</h1>

            <p>Rendered two-dimensional images or two-dimensional videos of a scene that includes 3D models generated 
            with ManuelbastioniLAB are not considered a derived product of the licensed 3D database and 3D base models.</p> 
            
            <p>Assuming that the rendering depicts a non-reverse-engineering scene[<a href="guide_license.html#reverse_engineering_scene">*</a>], due to many factors (i.e. the transformation from 3D space to 2D space, 
            the position and the type of camera used, the other 3D elements included in the scene, 
            the position and type of lights, the post production, the composition of multiple characters, 
            the path of the camera, ecc.) the original 3D data is fundamentally modified and transformed sufficiently that it constitutes an original work.</p>

            <p>For this reason, the author of the 2D rendering is the sole copyright owner of 2D image/video created by him and the sole responsible for the use of his 2D image/video.</p>
