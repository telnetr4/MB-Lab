            <h1>Rigging systems</h1>

            <p>In version 1.6 ManuelbastioniLAB offers two new advanced rigging systems: the base muscle and the inverse kinematic.</p>

            <p><img src="illustrations/manual/poses09.png" alt="Rigging selector"/></p>

            <h2>Muscle base system</h2>

            <p>
            It's called "base" system to distinguish it from the "full" muscle system that is planned for future releases of the lab.
            </p>

            <p>
            One of the main difference between the two systems is that the "full" one will be anatomically more accurate, 
            but it will require (probably) to have the lab installed on the production machine. On the contrary, the "base" system already implemented in lab 1.6,
            that simulates only the main muscles masses, relies on the standard Blender tools and after 
            the <a href="guide_finalize_the_character.html">finalization step</a>
            the character will work on any recent version of Blender, with or without the lab installed.
            </p>

            <p>
            The images show some features of the muscle system and a comparison with the base system:

            <img src="illustrations/gallery/thumbnails/gallery_160_06.png" alt="" class="fade" height="150" width="150">
            </a>

            <a href="gallery_160_05.html">
            <img src="illustrations/gallery/thumbnails/gallery_160_05.png" alt="" class="fade" height="150" width="150">
            </a>
            </p>

            <p>
            To reach this goal, a big amount of time was spent to design a flexible
            armature using only basic built-in components offered by Blender, without drivers but only constraints. The structure was heavily 
            tested with many benchmark animations, in particular to avoid or minimize the problem of unwanted rotations that sometime are created by 
            the solver for extreme angles. The same sessions were also used to test the improved animation retarget system 1.6.0. Some of the cool results are in the video
            that was created during the development.
            </p>

            </a>
            </p>


            <h2>Inverse Kinematics system</h2>

            <p>
            The IK structure offers a set of additional bones used to control the limbs in an easy and intuitive way. 
            </p>

            <p>
            It includes special controllers for fingers 
            (the complex movement open-close of each finger, obtained as a combination of four bones, is handled by one controller), controllers for metacarpals
            (one controller handles contemporary the movement of all the metacarpals), controller for heel-toe movement, track target for head, and more.
            Some features are illustrated in  <a href="https://youtu.be/zupmxmAR2Sg">this video</a>.
