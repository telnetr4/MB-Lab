New Features
============

In version 1.7.3 is the addition of the Auto Updater.

This will allow users to update to new versions of MB-Lab without having to go to Github or reclone manually.

The updater can auto check at a user defined set interval.

The updater also can make backups of MB-Lab so if by chance a buggy version is released, this can revert back to working version.

The only downside is that the updater works from version 1.7.3 onward so it is not possible to revert back to previous versions, so this makes it a pretty important update as well.
